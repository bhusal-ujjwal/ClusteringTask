# ClusteringTask
Load the dataset regarding the life expectancy and GDP of some countries for 2015.
Load the dataset, see what it looks like, try to get the info, describe the dataset do the cleaning if needed.

The main task is you must use K-means and agglomerative clustering to cluster the data into different clusters based on Life expectancy and GPD.

But it between you must:
plot scatterplot and jointplot using sns library for life expectancy and GDP and once without setting hue, and once with setting hue to the status ( in the database it shows if a country is developed or no )
for setting the number of clusters you must use elbow method.
